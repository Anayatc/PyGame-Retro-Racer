# PyGame-Retro-Racer

Retro arcade racing game using PyGame

### Project Objective:
I wanted to try out programming a game with python and get to understand how to structure game logic, at it's core this 
is a very basic game where the user presses the left and right keys to move a sprite and avoid falling obstacles.
